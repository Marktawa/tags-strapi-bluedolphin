With the vast number of languages spoken by users worldwide in different regions, an application's ability to serve content to users in their locales gradually becomes a needed functionality for better user engagement and retention.

Through the [i18n plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/plugins/i18n.html#installation), Strapi supports the development of this functionality by providing application admins the ability to store data in different locales and serve them to users within the respective locales.

Within this article, we will explore more about the i18n plugin.
If you are interested in trying out the result of this tutorial before going through the article, we have it here for you to try out.

# Goal

This article aims to help you understand what Internationalization is and how you can implement it in a Strapi application. This article is broken down into the two sections below;

- Understanding what Internationalization is at a broad level.
- Using the [i18n plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/plugins/i18n.html#installation) to implement Internationalization within your Strapi application.

To keep this article focused on its primary goal, we will not create a new Strapi application, but instead use this [Strapi eCommerce template](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-ecommerce).
The demo application would be an eCommerce store containing localized content for courses to be sold. Using the [i18n plugin](https://strapi.io/features/internationalization), the eCommerce application would serve localized content from two locales to a front-end application built with Gatsby.

# What you will learn

This article will help you understand what Internationalization is and how you can implement it in a new or existing Strapi application.
If you are new to Strapi, Strapi is easy to learn and feature-rich headless content management system (CMS) with support for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, MySQL, and MariaDB.

# Prerequisites

To run the two demo applications within this tutorial, you need to have node v12 installed on your local machine and understand React.js as we build out the front-end application.

# Introduction

So far, you have seen the word [**Internationalization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization) reoccur all over this article. â€” Let's pause at this point to understand what this recurring word really means.

From the [W3C definition](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n.en#i18n), Internationalization is said to be "the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy localization for various target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language."

You would often find Internationalization shortened to i18n, with "i" and "n" representing the first and last letters. In contrast, the number 18 represents the total number of letters when "i" and "n" are subtracted.

While Internationalization refers to designing a product for various target audiences, localization can be narrowed to refer to the **adaptation** of a product, application, or document content to meet the language, cultural and other requirements of a specific target market (a *locale*).

One important thing to note is that the application of Internationalization and localization, as defined above, varies across different products as each product has its various target audience across other localities with differing cultural requirements.
You would find the word **locale** used in various parts of this article. A locale refers to the language with which the content is being created with.

For developers managing the content of their application using Strapi, the recently released i18n plugin provides admins with the means of localising the content served to their end-users.

# Backend Setup

For this tutorial, we'll use the [Ecommerce template](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-ecommerce) developed by Remi and connect a Gatsby to it for fetching the pre-stored data.

>**Note**: 
>
>*For this tutorial, we will use yarn as the package manager. You can, however, use npm if preferred.*

# Step 1: Scaffold Strapi Project

Create an empty project directory to store your project. This folder would serve as the root folder. The frontend application and backend code will be stored in subdirectories. I will name my project directory `bluedolphin`.

```bash
$ mkdir bluedolphin
```

Change directory to the project directory `bluedolphin`.
```bash
$ cd bluedolphin
```

Initialize source control.
```bash
/bluedolphin $ git init
```

Create a strapi application with the Ecommerce template:
```bash
/bluedolphin $ yarn create strapi-app backend --quickstart --template https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-ecommerce 
```

This command creates your Strapi app in the folder named `backend`. The `--quickstart` flag sets up your Strapi app with an SQLite database. The `--template` flag retrieves the specific template to install in your app. In this case, we retrieved the `strapi-template-ecommerce`, hosted by `strapi` on GitHub.

After a successful installation, the CLI would automatically start the Strapi application. Open the **Strapi Admin Registration** interface from your web browser at [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin) to create the admin user for your Strapi application.

The Ecommerce template you just cloned contains the following;

- Three prebuilt collection types:
    - Categories
    - Users
    - Products
- A project that has already populated data within the collection types above.

Feel free to modify the existing data. They provide a good starting point for building this project.

Next, install the [GraphQL plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/plugins/graphql.html) to add GraphQL support to this Strapi Application.

```bash
$ yarn strapi install graphql
```

After installing the plugin above, you can access your project's GraphiQL playground at [http://localhost:1337/graphql](http://localhost:1337/graphql) to write queries and mutations for working with the existing data.

# Step 2: Configure Strapi Internationalization (i18n) Plugin

The [Internationalization plugin](https://strapi.io/features/internationalization) gives Strapi application admins the feature to create, manage and distribute localized content across different languages, also known as locales.

Rather than automatically translate delivered content, the i18n plugin allows developers to fetch the right content based on the user's locale.

>**Note**:
> 
>*The i18n plugin ships by default with Strapi applications running on version 4.x.x. Please refer to the* [*installation*](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/plugins/i18n.html#installation) *section of the plugin documentation*.

By default, the i18n plugin has `en` ( English ) as the default locale. However, more locales and their respective content can be added either using the Admin panel or the Strapi Content API.

We would add one more locale to the categories content-type en locale shipped with the cloned eCommerce template for this guide.


Using the [Admin panel](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/development/admin-customization.html), navigate to **the Settings** page of your Strapi application, then click on the **Internationalization** option within the **Global Settings.**

![Internationalization-settings.png](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_E9465E6BF58AAED0BF9285C24F68A0129D259F28691705ADE2170BBEFA500B1A_1621048098879_locale-btn.png)

# Step 3: Add A New Locale

Locate and click the "**Add a Locale**" button at the top right corner to open the locale modal. Using the locales dropdown, select a new locale, select a display name, or leave the default locale name.

For this guide, use the `fr` locale with a default display name of French as shown below;

![locale-configuration.png](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_E9465E6BF58AAED0BF9285C24F68A0129D259F28691705ADE2170BBEFA500B1A_1621048491412_locale-configuration.png)


# Step 4: Enable Content-Type Localization

By default, the content types within the cloned eCommerce template do not have localization enabled. 

- Click on **Content-Types Builder** in your Strapi dashboard.
- Select the content type to be localized.
- Click the edit pencil icon of the chosen content type to open the edit icon.
- From the edit modal, click the **Advanced Settings** tab, then enable localization using the checkbox at the bottom of the modal.

![enable-localization.png](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_E9465E6BF58AAED0BF9285C24F68A0129D259F28691705ADE2170BBEFA500B1A_1621051131371_enable-localization.png)


# Step 5: Add Locale Content

As stated earlier, the i18n plugin does not automatically translate content stored with Strapi into different locales; instead, it gives admins the feature to store and deliver multiple locale entries.

We will only create one new product for this guide and link it to an existing category to work with the i18n plugin. This should be enough to give you a working idea when implementing Internationalization with the i18n plugin in your application.

- Navigate to the Products content-type page and click the "**Add New Products**" button to create a new product.
- Enter a localized title, price, description, and any image to represent this product. You can also use [Google Translate](https://paper.dropbox.com/ep/redirect/external-link?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.google.com%2F&hmac=MgEmKwxEZ8ok6K0i9io0Mwd7qwo370LwHr%2FDA8NNFHM%3D) to translate the content.
- Within the Internationalization section in the box positioned at the right, click the **locales** dropdown to select the newly created `fr` ( French ) locale.
![localised-product.png](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_E9465E6BF58AAED0BF9285C24F68A0129D259F28691705ADE2170BBEFA500B1A_1621055552167_localized-product.png)


*Remember to click the* ***Save*** *button to save this new category!*
Now, you would link this product with the previously created category.

- Navigate to the Categories content-type page to see a list of all categories created in the default English ( en ) locale.
- Click the locale dropdown at the right to switch from the default English ( en ) locale to the recently created French ( fr ) locale. Select the "base de donnÃ©es" category in `fr` locale that was created.
- From the products list positioned at the bottom right of the category page, select the "**base de donnÃ©es relationnelle**" as a product to link the category.

*Remember to save the new update before exiting the category page!*
The Strapi application has been fully set up with the i18n plugin, as we have created a new French ( fr ) locale, added a new category in this locale, and linked a product to the category.
You can now fetch localized content from your Strapi application using the Strapi GraphQL content API.
**Frontend Application**
**Gatsby Setup**
Launch the Gatsby installer to create a Gatsby application with the name **i18n-frontend** from your terminal using the command below;

    npm init gatsby

After the installation process is completed, you run the development server of the newly created Gatsby application to be sure the installation was successful.

    cd i18n-frontend

**Application Styling**
Create a `components` folder within the `src` directory and create a `layout.js` file containing the code below to create a wrapper using React-helmet to wrap each page with styles from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) using a CDN link.

    // ./src/components/layout.js
     
    import React from "react";
    import { Helmet } from "react-helmet";
     
    const Layout = ({ children }) => (
     <div>
       <Helmet defer={false}>
         <link
          rel="stylesheet"
          href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
        integrity="sha384-B0vP5xmATw1+K9KRQjQERJvTumQW0nPEzvF6L/Z6nronJ3oUOFUFpCjEUQouq2+l"
           crossorigin="anonymous"
         />
       </Helmet>
       {children}
     </div>
    );
     
    export default Layout;

Create a `styles.js` file in the `src` directory. This stylesheet is where you would keep all CSS-in-js styles created using Styles-components.

    // ./src/styles.js
    
    import styled from "styled-components";
     
    export const Cards = styled.ul`
     display: grid;
     padding-top: 1rem;
     grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(20rem, 1fr));
     grid-gap: 2rem 1rem;
     place-items: center;
    `;
     
    export const Item = styled.div`
     height: 370px;
     width: 300px;
     border-radius: 7px;
     box-shadow: 0 2px 3px #c0c0c0;
     background: #fff;
     color: #1d1b84;
     text-align: center;
     div {
       padding: 0.1rem 0.5rem;
       h4 {
         text-align: center;
         font-weight: 600;
       }
     }
    `;
     
    export const Button = styled.button`
     background: #1d1b84;
     border: 1px solid #1d1b84;
     color: #fff;
     border-radius: 3px;
     padding: 0.3rem 1rem;
    `;
     
    export const Image = styled.img`
     height: 250px;
     width: 250px;
     object-fit: contain;
    `;
     
    export const Flex = styled.div`
     display: flex;
     width: 100%;
     align-items: center;
     flex-direction: ${(props) => props.direction};
     justify-content: ${(props) => props.justify};
    `;
      
    export const Banner = styled.div`
     padding: 2rem 3rem;
     text-align: center;
     h4 {
       font-weight: 600;
     }
    `;
     
    export const CategoryCtn = styled.div`
     width: 20rem;
     padding: .5rem 1rem;
     background: #fff;
     margin: 1rem;
     border-radius: 5px;
     box-shadow: 0 2px 3px #c0c0c0;
    `
     
    export const Container = styled.div`
     background: #ebf4fd;
     height: calc(100vh - 110px);
    `;

The styles exported in the file above would be used when creating other components.
Install the following extra dependencies needed for this Gatsby application;

    yarn add gatsby-source-graphql moment react-icons styled-components babel-plugin-styled-components 

Modify the `gatsby-config.js` file with the code below to register the plugins installed above.

    // gatsby-config.js
    
     module.exports = {
     siteMetadata: {
       title: "i18n-frontend",
     },
     plugins: [
       "gatsby-plugin-react-helmet",
       {
         resolve: "gatsby-plugin-manifest",
         options: {
           icon: "src/images/icon.png",
         },
       },
       { resolve: `gatsby-plugin-styled-components`},
       {
         resolve: "gatsby-source-graphql",
         options: {
             // Arbitrary name for the remote schema Query type
             typeName: "STRAPI",
             // Field for remote schema. You'll use this in your Gatsby query
             fieldName: "strapi",
             url: `${process.env.GATSBY_STRAPI_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT}/graphql`,
         },
      },
     ],
    };

In the configuration file above, you have registered [styled components](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/styling/styled-components/#gatsby-skip-here) for styling the application.
Also, using the [*gatsby-source-graphql*](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-graphql) plugin, you configured the Gatsby application to connect with your Strapi Application using its GraphQL API endpoint stored in [environment variables](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables).
You probably don't have the `GATSBY_STRAPI_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` environment variable yet.
Create a `*.env*` file with the following field in the root folder of your Gatsby application.

    GATSBY_STRAPI_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:1337"

Next, stop and start the Gatsby `develop server` for the remote Strapi schema to be merged into the Gatsby application schema.
Using GraphiQL editor for your Gatsby application at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`, test the GraphQL Query in the image below that you would make from the gatsby application to retrieve data from your Strapi Application.

![gatsby-graphql-playground.png](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_E9465E6BF58AAED0BF9285C24F68A0129D259F28691705ADE2170BBEFA500B1A_1621109421026_strapi-gatsby-graphql.png)


In the GraphiQL playground above, you can observe the result of the `getData` query executed to retrieve data from your running Strapi application. Also, the GraphiQL playground shows the Strapi fields that have been merged in the Gatsby application schema.
Now that the Strapi Schema has been merged with your Gatsby application schema, you can perform GraphQL operations directly from the application.
Create a `gatsby-node.js` file in the root folder of the gatsby application and paste the code snippet below into the file to fetch data from the Strapi application and create dynamic pages with the fetched data.

    // ./gatsby-node.js
    
    const path = require("path");
    
    exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
      const { createPage } = actions;
    
      const productsQuery = await graphql(`
        query getData {
          strapi {
            categories(locale: "all") {
              locale
              id
              name
              slug
               localizations {
                 locale
              }
              products {
                locale
                title
                description
                price
                slug
                image {
                  provider
                  width
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      `);
    
      // Template to create dynamic pages from.
      const productsTemplate = path.resolve(`src/pages/products.js`);
    
      productsQuery.data.strapi.categories.forEach(
        ({ title, id, products, price, slug, name, localizations, locale }) =>
        {
            if (localizations.length > 0) {
                localizations.forEach((data) => {
                    data.locale
                        return createPage({
                            path: `product/${id}/${data.locale.toLowerCase()}`,
                            component: productsTemplate,
                            context: { 
                            slug, name, title,
                            id, price, products, locale : data.locale, 
                            localizations 
                          },
                        })
                })
            }
    
            return createPage({
                path: `product/${id}/${locale}`,
                component: productsTemplate,
                context: { slug, name, title, id, price, products, locale, localizations }
            })
        }
      );
    };
                                                            

You would observe the following operations below performed to retrieve data from the Strapi application from the file above.

- First, the `getData` query is executed with a `locale` parameter to fetch `all` categories content-type in the Strapi application.
- An iteration is made on each category contained in the returned array. Each time the iteration is made, a dynamic page is created using Gatsby's [create page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-and-modifying-pages/#creating-pages-in-gatsby-nodejs) API with the `product.js` component as a template, passing the `locale` and `id` of the category into the component as props.

**Note:** The path option specifies the `URL` of each of the dynamic pages. In our use case, each dynamic page created is differentiated using the unique category `id` generated by Strapi.
When an iteration is made, we also check if the category has localized content in it. The Strapi Content API would return an empty array if a collection type has localization enabled but has no localized content.
If a collection type has localized content in our use case, a new dynamic page is created to display content in that locale.
Before you restart the gatsby, develop a server to use the new changes in the `gatsby-node.js` file. But, first, let us create the `product` template and a home page to display all categories.
Create a `products.js` file within the `src/pages` directory and add the React component in the code snippet below;

    // src/pages/products.js
    
    import React, { useState } from "react";
    import { Cards, Item, Button, Image, Flex, Banner, Container } from "./styles";
    import {graphql, Link, navigate} from 'gatsby'
    
    import Header from "../components/header";
    import Footer from "../components/footer";
    import Layout from "../components/layout";
    
    const shrinkText = (text, length) => {
      let txt = text.split(" ");
    
      if (txt.length < 7) {
        return text;
      }
    
      return [ ...txt.splice(0, length), '...' ].join(" ")
    };
    
    const Index = ({ pageContext, data }) => {
      const { name, localizations, id } = pageContext;
      const { categories } = data.strapi
    
      return (
        <Layout>
          <Header />
          <Container>
            <Banner>
              <br />
              <h4 style={{ textAlign: "center" }}> {name} </h4>
    
              <p> Display products in:
                {categories[0].localizations.map(({ locale}) =>
                    <Link to={`/product/${id}/${locale.toLowerCase()}`} >
                      <span style={{padding : "0 .5rem"}} > {locale} </span>
                    </Link>
                )}
              </p>
            </Banner>
            <hr />
    
            <Cards>
              {categories.map(({products}) =>
                    products.map(({ id, title, price, description }) => (
                        <Item key={id}>
                          <div>
                            <Image
                                src={
                                  "https://res.cloudinary.com/dkfptto8m/image/upload/v1620468926/shirts.jpg"
                                }
                            />
                            <h5> {title} </h5>
                            <p style={{opacity : ".8"}} >{shrinkText(description, 4)} </p>

                          </div>
                        </Item>
                    )))}
            </Cards>

        </Layout>
      );
    };
    
    export const query = graphql`
            query fetchLocaleData($locale: String) {
              strapi {
                categories(locale: $locale) {
                    localizations {
                        locale
                    }
                  products {
                    title
                    description
                    price
                  }
                }
              }
          }
    `
    
    export default Index;

Going through the code block above, which makes up the product component, you would observe the following;
Although the page is created dynamically using the createPages API, the component makes an extra graphQL query to fetch localised content using the locale value passed in from the [createPages](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-and-modifying-pages/#creating-pages-in-gatsby-nodejs) API when the page is created dynamically.
All available locales are displayed at the top banner giving users the feature to click on the links to view the page content in another locale.
With your Gatsby server running, navigate to the [http://localhost:8000/product/1/en](http://localhost:8000/product/1/en), it should display the product page with an `id` of 1, having "back" as the category name as shown below;

The image above shows all products within the "**Backend**" category served in the English ( en ) locale. The top banner contains links to other pages containing products for the same category but in a different locale.
For example, clicking the `fr` link would display products in the French locale as shown below;

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_E9465E6BF58AAED0BF9285C24F68A0129D259F28691705ADE2170BBEFA500B1A_1621171393979_fr-product.png)


Above, we can see the recently created product with the backend category displayed in the `fr` locale.
Finally, let's create a home page that loads all categories with links to their respective products.
Create a `home.js` file within the `src/pages` directory and add the React component in the code snippet below;

    // src/pages/home.js
    
    import React from "react";
    import { graphql, useStaticQuery, Link } from "gatsby";
    import { FiCalendar, FiBook } from "react-icons/fi";
    import moment from "moment";
    
    import {
      Container,
      Flex,
      Banner,
      Cards,
      CategoryCtn,
    } from "./styles";
    import Header from "../components/header";
    import Footer from "../components/footer";
    import Layout from "../components/layout";
    
    const Index = ({ pageContext }) => {
      const {strapi} = useStaticQuery(graphql`
        query fetchAllCourses {
          strapi {
            categories {
              id
              name
              created_at
              slug
              locale
              products { id }
            }
          }
        }
      `);
    
      return (
        <Layout>
          <Header />
          <Container>
            <Banner>
              <h4> STRAPI COURSE STORE </h4>

            <hr />
    
            <Cards >
              {strapi.categories.map(({ id, name, products, created_at, locale }) => (
                <CategoryCtn key={id}>
                  <div>
                    <Link to={`/product/${id}/${locale}`}>
                      <h5> {name} </h5>
                    </Link>
                    <Flex
                      direction="row"
                      style={{
                        opacity: ".8",
                      }}
                    >
                      <div
                        style={{
                          marginRight: ".3rem",
                        }}
                      >
                        <FiCalendar size={19} />
                      </div>

                      <div
                        style={{
                          marginRight: ".3rem",
                          display: "flex",
                          justifyContent: "center",
                          alignItems: "center",
                        }}
                      >
                        <FiBook size={19} />
                      </div>
    
                      <div
                        style={{
                          display: "flex",
                          justifyContent: "center",
                          alignItems: "center",
                        }}
                      >
                        {products.length} Courses Available
                      </div>
                    </Flex>
                  </div>
                </CategoryCtn>
              ))}
            </Cards>
            <Footer />
          </Container>
        </Layout>
      );
    };
    
    export default Index;

Save the new file and navigate your Gatsby application homepage to view categories fetched from your Strapi application.

At this point, clicking on any of the categories shown in the image above would navigate you to the product page showing the list of products within that category.

# **Conclusion**

Huge congrats to you. By going through this article, you have learned about Internationalization and localization and how the i18n plugin helps you achieve localization in your Strapi application regarding stored content.
First, we started by explaining what the terms localization and Internationalization meant.
Secondly, we cloned an existing Strapi application using the eCommerce template. Then, we created a new locale and enabled localization on the current content types from the admin panel, after which we inserted a new product in a French ( fr ) locale.
Lastly, we created a new Gatsby application to fetch localized data from the Strapi application.
